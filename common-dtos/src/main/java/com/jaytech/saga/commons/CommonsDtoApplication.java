/**
 * Topics:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Topics are used in publish-subscribe (pub-sub) messaging patterns.</li>
 *   <li>In a topic, a message is published to a topic, and multiple consumers can subscribe to that topic to receive and process messages independently.</li>
 *   <li>Each message sent to a topic is broadcast to all active subscribers.</li>
 *   <li>Subscribers receive all messages published to the topic, even if they join later.</li>
 *   <li>Messages in a topic are not typically persisted for individual consumption. Instead, they are retained for a configurable period of time.</li>
 *   <li>Apache Kafka is a popular distributed streaming platform that uses topics as its primary messaging abstraction.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Queues:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Queues are used in point-to-point (P2P) messaging patterns.</li>
 *   <li>In a queue, a message is sent to a queue, and only one consumer (receiver) will receive and process the message.</li>
 *   <li>Each message is consumed by only one consumer, ensuring that each message is processed by a single recipient.</li>
 *   <li>Queues can persist messages for individual consumption until they are explicitly acknowledged by the consumer and removed from the queue.</li>
 *   <li>If multiple consumers are connected to the same queue, the messages are load-balanced across consumers, but each message is still delivered to only one consumer.</li>
 *   <li>Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ are examples of messaging systems that use queues as the main messaging abstraction.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * In summary, topics are used in pub-sub patterns and broadcast messages to multiple subscribers,
 * while queues are used in P2P patterns and deliver each message to only one consumer.
 * The choice between topics and queues depends on the messaging pattern and the desired behavior
 * of the messaging system in your application.
